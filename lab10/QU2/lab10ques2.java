//Write a program that, given a sorted array of integer values with duplicates, counts the number of
//occurrences of a given number (input by the user) and prints the count. Your program must display an
//appropriate message if the number is not found in the array.
//Note: You are required to apply divide and conquer to find a solution with time complexity O(log n).
//Hint: A solution can be found by modifying the binary search algorithm. The latter can be used to find the
//indices of the first and last occurrences of the given number. These indices can then easily be used to
//compute the number of occurrences.
